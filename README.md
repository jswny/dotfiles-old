# Dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles which I use on a daily basis on MacOS!

## Philosophy
- Minimal configuration where possible
- Use the [XDG Base Directory Spec](https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) where possible/reasonable
  - Accordingly, consume the existing XDG environment variable if possible or use a default set at the point of use, instead of relying on XDG variables being already set before the point of use.
  - See [this Arch Linux guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory) for a good summary of which programs support XDG
- Support MacOS and Linux
  - Support Windows to some extent, but only through WSL. When WSL 2 is stable Windows support might be more feasable, but at the moment WSL 1 breaks Fish
- Fail gracefully or use defaults wherever possible, but warn the user when this occurs

## Files and Linking
The following files are contained in this repository. Each file/directory is listed with its description and where to symlink it in your local filesystem.
- `fish/config.fish` -- General Fish configuration
  - `ln -s fish/config.fish ~/.config/fish/config.fish`
- `fish/fishfile` -- Fisherman plugin list
  - `ln -s fish/fishfile ~/.config/fish/fishfile`
- `hyper/hyper.js` -- Hyper Terminal configuration
  - `ln -s hyper/hyper.js ~/.config/hyper/hyper.js`
- `iterm2/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist` -- iTerm2 general configuration
  - Configure iTerm2 to use this file for preferences directly (symlinks don't work)
- `iterm2/profiles.json` -- iTerm2 [Dynamic Profiles](https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-dynamic-profiles.html) configuration
  - `ln -s iterm2 ~/Library/Application\ Support/iTerm2/DynamicProfiles/profiles.json`
- `nvim/init.vim` -- NeoVim configuration
  - `ln -s nvim/init.vim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim`
- `nvim/lcnv-settings.json` -- LanguageClient-NeoVim configuration for language servers
  - `ln -s ~/Github/dotfiles/nvim/lcnv-settings.json ~/.config/nvim/lcnv-settings.json`
- `tmux/.tmux.conf` -- Tmux configuration
  - `ln -s tmux/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf`

## Prerequisites
### Packages
Install the following packages (packages delimited by `*` are not directly required for any dotfiles but are tools that I use regardless):
- Either [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) or [Hyper Terminal](https://hyper.is/)
- [GNU Coreutils](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/coreutils) if you are using MacOS
- [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/)
- [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)
- [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [FD](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
- [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- [The Fuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck)
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- [Tmux Plugin Manager (TPM)](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) (must install from `HEAD`)

### Setup
- [Fish as your default shell](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#tut_switching_to_fish)
```sh
echo /usr/local/bin/fish | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish
```
- Get [dircolors-solarized](https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized)
  - Clone with `git clone https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized.git ~/.local/share/dircolors-solarized`
- TPM plugins installed
  - <kbd>prefix</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> inside Tmux
- See `init.vim` for the additional setup required for NeoVim
- Fish colors set to Solarized Dark
  - Configure with `fish_config` in the shell
